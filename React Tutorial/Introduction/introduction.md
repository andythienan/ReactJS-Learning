# What is React ?
- It is a front-end JavaScript library
- A tool for building UI components

# How does React work ?
- React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory
- When we build an application with React, it will create a Virtual DOM in the memory of our computer instead manipulating directly with DOM in browser
- Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the real DOM but this copy is placed in the memory
